# RadiusGUI
For my project, I built a GUI that Ameriband employees can use to create a new network in a fraction of the amount of time that it previously took. The GUI runs the set of Linux commands to create the network and accepts entered modifications to build the specified network. This software product reduces the technical skills and time required to create the network server instance.
